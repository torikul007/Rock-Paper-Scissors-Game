# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Step 1: Setting Up Your HTML
Create an HTML structure for the game, including buttons for the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors and a display area to show the result.
Step 2: Styling with CSS
Create a styles.css file to style the game elements. You can add your own styles to make it visually appealing.

Step 3: JavaScript for Game Logic
Create a script.js file to implement the game logic. The JavaScript code should handle player choices, generate computer choices, and determine the winner.

Here's the JavaScript code for the game logic
Step 4: Testing and Playing
Open your HTML file in a web browser to test and play the game. Click on the "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" buttons to make your choice, and the computer will generate its choice. The winner will be displayed on the screen.

This is a simple implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. You can further enhance it by adding more styles, animations, and additional features if you like.
